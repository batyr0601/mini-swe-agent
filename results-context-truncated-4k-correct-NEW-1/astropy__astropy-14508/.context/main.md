`io.fits.Card` may use a string representation of floats that is larger than necessary
### Description

In some scenarios, `io.fits.Card` may use a string representation of floats that is larger than necessary, which can force comments to be truncated. Due to this, there are some keyword/value/comment combinations that are impossible to create via `io.fits` even though they are entirely possible in FITS.

### Expected behavior

Being able to create any valid FITS Card via `io.fits.Card`.

### How to Reproduce

[This valid FITS file](https://github.com/astropy/astropy/files/10922976/test.fits.gz) contains the following card in the header:

`HIERARCH ESO IFM CL RADIUS = 0.009125 / [m] radius arround actuator to avoid`

We can read the header of this file and get this card without any iss...

## TODO List

<!-- 
Add detailed, specific TODOs when starting a task. Good examples:

- [ ] Find the function causing the error (look in X module)
- [ ] Understand why Y happens when Z is called
- [ ] Implement fix by changing A to B
- [ ] Test the fix with the original reproduction case
